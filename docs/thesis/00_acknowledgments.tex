\begin{acknowledgments}

First, I would like to thank my parents, my sisters, my girlfriend and my closest friends for providing me with unfailing support and continuous encouragement throughout my years of study. This accomplishment would not have been possible without them.\\

I would also like to acknowledge my fellow students for making tough lessons less tiring and for stimulating me whenever my laziness was almost going to win me.\\

Finally, I express my sincere gratitude to my advisor Prof. Grisetti for his patience, guidance and insightful comments.
